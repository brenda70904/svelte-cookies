# Svelte Good

## Research Conducted By: Tyler Bennett and Brenda Jow

## Overall Score and Comments

Score (Out of 10): 10

### General Comments

Pros

1. Very intuitive. If you are comfortable with Vanilla JS/CSS/HTML you should be right at home with Svelte.

2. Separation of Concerns. Even though all 3 elements are in the same document there is very little mixing of your script, style, and markup. Compare this to React where you can end up using JSX to write HTML in your Javascript, but then use curly braces to type Javascript in your HTML, but then use an object to type CSS in your Javascript, but then use a string template literal to type English into Javascript. Absurd really.

Cons

1. Ecosystem. You know you've ventured out of the safety of React when you're installing a routing npm package with just 15000 weekly downloads. 

2. State Management. One advantage of the more opinionated style of React is that there are patterns to fall into. Svelte is less cut and dry.

### Documentation

The documentation was very helpful, particularly that they called out some anti-patterns in some of their documentation.

### Ramp-Up Projections

Probably the biggest strength of Svelte is that it is so similar to technologies any web developer should know anyway. Relatively little learning curve.

### Community Support and Adoption levels

Compared to more established frameworks this is clearly an area that Svelte suffers. With React it feels like you're always an npm package away from anything you want to do, but with Svelte you might actually need to solve it yourself.

### Operating Instructions

If someone were to download your repo (above), what steps do they need to take to run the application

`npm start` will start the server.
